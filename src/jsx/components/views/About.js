We created the Chicago Health Atlas so that you can review, explore and compare health-related data over time and across communities. In addition, the Chicago Health Atlas provides a place for residents to see our progress implementing Healthy Chicago 2.0, the citywide plan to improve health equity.</p>
                  <p className="p">Our hope is that you will use this data to both better understand health in Chicago and identify opportunities to improve health and well-being.</p>
                  <p className="p">The Chicago Health Atlas is, by design, an evolving tool. Through new partnerships, improved data and continuous updates to the site, we will be better equipped to understand and improve our city&#39;s health. </p>

                  Note about zip codes: U.S. Postal Service ZIP Codes are designed to meet the day-to-day operational needs of the U.S. Postal Service and tend to change frequently. To account for this instability, as well as the emergence of new ZIP codes over time and low population estimates in certain ZIP codes (i.e. less than 20,000 residents), the following steps were taken:
                  <br />
                  <ul className="v-about__small-list">
                    <li>▪ Zip Codes 60610 and 60654 were combined</li>
                    <li>▪ Zip Codes 60707 and 60635 were combined</li>
                    <li>▪ Zip Codes 60606, 60607 and 60661 were combined</li>

                  </ul>
                  The total number of ED visits and total population of ZIP codes 60707, 60638 and 60827 were included, regardless of whether the individual resided within the Chicago city limits.

                  Note about Economic Hardship Index: The Economic Hardship Index provides a relative, multidimensional measure of a community’s socioeconomic conditions.  These conditions affect the way people live and the opportunities available to them; ultimately they impact the health of the individuals in a community.  A community with a high Economic Hardship Index score has poor social and/or economic conditions.  The value of the hardship index is standardized across community areas and zipcodes and are thus comparable to one another. See http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/cities_and_neighborhoods/2004-08-an_update_on_urban_hardship.pdf for more information

                  The Economic Hardship Index is composed of six indicators:
                  <ol className="v-about__small-list">
                    <li>Crowded housing- percentage of housing units with more than one person per room</li>
                    <li>Poverty- percentage of people living below the federal poverty level</li>
                    <li>Unemployment-percentage of people over age 16 who are unemployed</li>
                    <li>Education- percentage of people over age 25 without a high school education</li>
                    <li>Dependency- percentage under age 18 and over age 64</li>
                    <li>Income- per capita income of the community</li>

                  Note about Child Opportunity Index:
                  <p className="v-about__small-p">The Child Opportunity Index measures community characteristics that influence a child’s health and development.  The lower the score, the fewer the opportunities that are available in a community to help children thrive.</p>
                  <p className="v-about__small-p">The Child Opportunity Index is composed of 19 individual metrics in three primary domains: education (education attainment in the community and availability of education to children), health and environment (access to health services and accessibility healthy spaces), social and economic (socioeconomic factors).  The values of the child opportunity index are standardized across community areas and zipcodes and are thus comparable to one another.

                  Data Suppression and Reliability:
                  <p className="v-about__small-p">The symbol ‘*’ is used throughout the website to indicate when rates should be interpreted with caution due to small counts or small population denominators which might make the rate unstable when comparing across years.  Data are suppressed and, thus, unavailable when the thresholds for counts, sample size are extremely small  or parameter estimates such as relative standard error or 95% confidence intervals are deemed to be unfit for display.  Protection of an individual’s confidentiality is of paramount importance to this effort and no attempt should be made to identify individuals or households within city community areas and/or zip codes.  Specific guidelines used for flagging and suppressing data vary by indicator and can be found within the downloaded datasheet for each indicator.</p>
